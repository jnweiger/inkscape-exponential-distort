Inkscape extension: exponential-x
=================================

This [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) extension transforms an object along the x-axis.
The bounding box remains unchanged. Points near the center of the object move to 
create the illusion of a curved surface.
Points move left, if you choose an exponent > 1, and right if the exponent is < 1.
An exponent of 1.0 does exactly nothing.

This can be used in combination with the bend path effect to create a cone projection
that retains aspect ratio.
